@incollection{Flores2017,
	abstract = {When stakeholders commit to building infrastructure as part of strategic, long-term planning, the final facilities are not normally amenable to modification after completion. A consequence of this is that users are forced to operate within the original specifications for, at least, as long as it takes to carry out major refurbishments or retrofitting, and even then, the constraints imposed by the original layout may be inescapable. On one hand, the original infrastructure plans enhance (or limit) the users' ability to operate efficiently for years to come. As time passes and the payback period approaches, changing operating conditions and unforeseen bottlenecks in the original blueprint can, at best, affect the economic returns and, at worst, defeat the purpose of the whole project (see, for example, Castellon airport in Spain, which was built but is grossly underutilised), producing unanticipated economical, social and political repercussions. On the other hand, managers and operators (that is, those living with the consequences of the strategic planning) have some leeway to compensate for miscalculations by means of their tactical and operational planning. In this chapter, we explore the use of quantitative techniques to, first, amend bottlenecks and uncertain market and operating conditions that affect the performance of infrastructure investments (the tactic and operational levels), and second, validate the effectiveness of the original infrastructure design (the strategic level) under these changing conditions. More specifically, we present a rail scheduling case study where we combine demand forecasting using Machine Learning techniques and formal Operations Research methods to assess and maximise the value of already-existing infrastructure. Rail scheduling is a typical optimisation problem popular in the literature, but its potential value is bounded not only by its technical properties and specifications (how good the algorithm is) but also by the accuracy of data feeding the algorithm. Such data is critical in specifying the demand that a facility will experience in the future, and the costs that will be incurred to operate it. The use of intensive data analytics and appropriate Machine Learning techniques can resolve this and provide a substantial competitive edge for investors and operators of rail inter-modal terminals. We anticipate that Machine Learning algorithms that predict future demand, coupled with optimisation techniques that streamline operations of facilities, can be integrated to create tools that help policy makers and terminal operators maximise the value of their current infrastructure, while meeting ever-changing demand.},

@article{Banerjee2018d,
	abstract = {The thymus is the primary organ for the generation of naive T cells, a key component of the immune system. Tolerance of T cells to self is achieved primarily in the thymic medulla, where immature T cells (thymocytes) sample self-peptides presented by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). A sufficiently strong interaction activates the thymocytes leading to negative selection. A key question of current interest is whether there is any structure in the manner in which mTECs present peptides: can any mTEC present any peptide at any time, or are there particular patterns of correlated peptide presentation? We investigate this question using a mathematical model of negative selection. We find that correlated patterns of peptide presentation may be advantageous in negatively selecting low-degeneracy thymocytes (that is, those thymocytes which respond to relatively few peptides). We also quantify the probability that an auto-reactive thymocyte exits the thymus before it encounters a cognate antigen. The results suggest that heterogeneity of gene co-expression in mTECs has an effect on the probability of escape of autoreactive thymocytes.},

@article{Banerjee2017g,
	abstract = {Understanding how quickly pathogens replicate and how quickly the immune system responds is important for predicting the epidemic spread of emerging pathogens. Host body size, through its correlation with metabolic rates, is theoretically predicted to impact pathogen replication rates and immune system response rates. Here, we use mathematical models of viral time courses from multiple species of birds infected by a generalist pathogen (West Nile Virus; WNV) to test more thoroughly how disease progression and immune response depend on mass and host phylogeny. We use hierarchical Bayesian models coupled with nonlinear dynamical models of disease dynamics to incorporate the hierarchical nature of host phylogeny. Our analysis suggests an important role for both host phylogeny and species mass in determining factors important for viral spread such as the basic reproductive number, WNV production rate, peak viraemia in blood and competency of a host to infect mosquitoes. Our model is based on a principled analysis and gives a quantitative prediction for key epidemiological determinants and how they vary with species mass and phylogeny. This leads to new hypotheses about the mechanisms that cause certain taxonomic groups to have higher viraemia. For example, our models suggest that higher viral burst sizes cause corvids to have higher levels of viraemia and that the cellular rate of virus production is lower in larger species. We derive a metric of competency of a host to infect disease vectors and thereby sustain the disease between hosts. This suggests that smaller passerine species are highly competent at spreading the disease compared with larger non-passerine species. Our models lend mechanistic insight into why some species (smaller passerine species) are pathogen reservoirs and some (larger non-passerine species) are potentially dead-end hosts for WNV. Our techniques give insights into the role of body mass and host phylogeny in the spread of WNV and potentially other zoonotic diseases. The major contribution of this work is a computational framework for infectious disease modelling at the within-host level that leverages data from multiple species. This is likely to be of interest to modellers of infectious diseases that jump species barriers and infect multiple species. Our method can be used to computationally determine the competency of a host to infect mosquitoes that will sustain WNV and other zoonotic diseases. We find that smaller passerine species are more competent in spreading the disease than larger non-passerine species. This suggests the role of host phylogeny as an important determinant of within-host pathogen replication. Ultimately, we view our work as an important step in linking within-host viral dynamics models to between-host models that determine spread of infectious disease between different hosts.},

	abstract = {Rho GTPase-based signaling networks control cellular dynamics by coordinating protrusions and retractions in space and time. Here, we reveal a signaling network that generates pulses and propagating waves of cell contractions. These dynamic patterns emerge via self-organization from an activator-inhibitor network, in which the small GTPase Rho amplifies its activity by recruiting its activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1. Rho also inhibits itself by local recruitment of actomyosin and the associated RhoGAP Myo9b. This network structure enables spontaneous, self-limiting patterns of subcellular contractility that can explore mechanical cues in the extracellular environment. Indeed, actomyosin pulse frequency in cells is altered by matrix elasticity, showing that coupling of contractility pulses to environmental deformations modulates network dynamics. Thus, our study reveals a mechanism that integrates intracellular biochemical and extracellular mechanical signals into subcellular activity patterns to control cellular contractility dynamics.},

@article{Banerjee2016,
	abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging pathogen that has decimated bird populations and caused severe outbreaks of viral encephalitis in humans. Currently, little is known about the within-host viral kinetics of WNV during infection. We developed mathematical models to describe viral replication, spread and host immune response in wild-type and immunocompromised mice. Our approach fits a target cell-limited model to viremia data from immunocompromised knockout mice and an adaptive immune response model to data from wild-type mice. Using this approach, we first estimate parameters governing viral production and viral spread in the host using simple models without immune responses. We then use these parameters in a more complex immune response model to characterize the dynamics of the humoral immune response. Despite substantial uncertainty in input parameters, our analysis generates relatively precise estimates of important viral characteristics that are composed of nonlinear combinations of model parameters: we estimate the mean within-host basic reproductive number, R0, to be 2.3 (95{\%} of values in the range 1.7-2.9); the mean infectious virion burst size to be 2.9 plaque-forming units (95{\%} of values in the range 1.7-4.7); and the average number of cells infected per infectious virion to be between 0.3 and 0.99. Our analysis gives mechanistic insights into the dynamics of WNV infection and produces estimates of viral characteristics that are difficult to measure experimentally. These models are a first step towards a quantitative understanding of the timing and effectiveness of the humoral immune response in reducing host viremia and consequently the epidemic spread of WNV.},

@article{Levin2016,
	abstract = {Emerging strains of influenza, such as avian H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1, are more virulent than seasonal H1N1 influenza, yet the underlying mechanisms for these differences are not well understood. Subtle differences in how a given strain interacts with the immune system are likely a key factor in determining virulence. One aspect of the interaction is the ability of T cells to locate the foci of the infection in time to prevent uncontrolled expansion. Here, we develop an agent based spatial model to focus on T cell migration from lymph nodes through the vascular system to sites of infection. We use our model to investigate whether different strains of influenza modulate this process. We calibrate the model using viral and chemokine secretion rates we measure in vitro together with values taken from literature. The spatial nature of the model reveals unique challenges for T cell recruitment that are not apparent in standard differential equation models. In this model comparing three influenza viruses, plaque expansion is governed primarily by the replication rate of the virus strain, and the efficiency of the T cell search-and-kill is limited by the density of infected epithelial cells in each plaque. Thus for each virus there is a different threshold of T cell search time above which recruited T cells are unable to control further expansion. Future models could use this relationship to more accurately predict control of the infection.},

However, the traditional dimerizer rapamycin has limitations in certain in vivo applications because of its slow reversibility and its affinity for endogenous proteins. Described herein is a bioorthogonal system for rapidly reversible CID. A novel dimerizer with synthetic ligand of FKBP' (SLF') linked to trimethoprim (TMP). The SLF' moiety binds to the F36V mutant of FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and the TMP moiety binds to E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR). SLF'-TMP-induced heterodimerization of FKBP(F36V) and eDHFR with a dissociation constant of 0.12 $\mu$M. Addition of TMP alone was sufficient to rapidly disrupt this heterodimerization. Two examples are presented to demonstrate that this system is an invaluable tool, which can be widely used to rapidly and reversibly control protein function in vivo.},

@article{Mallick2019,
	abstract = {Microbial community metabolomics, particularly in the human gut, are beginning to provide a new route to identify functions and ecology disrupted in disease. However, these data can be costly and difficult to obtain at scale, while amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing data are readily available for populations of many thousands. Here, we describe a computational approach to predict potentially unobserved metabolites in new microbial communities, given a model trained on paired metabolomes and metagenomes from the environment of interest. Focusing on two independent human gut microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that our framework successfully recovers community metabolic trends for more than 50{\%} of associated metabolites. Similar accuracy is maintained using amplicon profiles of coral-associated, murine gut, and human vaginal microbiomes. We also provide an expected performance score to guide application of the model in new samples. Our results thus demonstrate that this ‘predictive metabolomic' approach can aid in experimental design and provide useful insights into the thousands of community profiles for which only metagenomes are currently available.},

@article{Aschenbrenner2019,
	abstract = {Dysregulated intestinal immune responses are the cause of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomic approaches we investigate the responses of monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to multiple stimuli and relate those to transcriptional responses in the inflamed intestine. We identify auto- and paracrine sensing of IL-1$\alpha$/$\beta$ and IL-10 regulation as key signals that control the development of inflammatory IL-23-producing monocytes. Uptake of whole bacteria induces IL-10 resistance and favours IL-23 secretion. IL-1$\alpha$/$\beta$+CD14+ monocyte signatures are enriched in patients with ulcerating intestinal inflammation and resistance to anti-TNF therapy. In contrast, IL-23 and tumour necrosis factor expression in the absence of this inflammatory monocyte signature was associated with homeostatic lymphocyte differentiation explaining why IL-23 and TNF expression alone are poor predictors for IBD activity. Gene co-expression analysis assists the identification of IBD patient subgroups that might benefit from IL-23p19 and/or IL-1$\alpha$/IL-1$\beta$-targeting therapies.},
