abstract = {Understanding how quickly pathogens replicate and how quickly the immune system responds is important for predicting the epidemic spread of emerging pathogens. Host body size, through its correlation with metabolic rates, is theoretically predicted to impact pathogen replication rates and immune system response rates. Here, we use mathematical models of viral time courses from multiple species of birds infected by a generalist pathogen (West Nile Virus; WNV) to test more thoroughly how disease progression and immune response depend on mass and host phylogeny. We use hierarchical Bayesian models coupled with nonlinear dynamical models of disease dynamics to incorporate the hierarchical nature of host phylogeny. Our analysis suggests an important role for both host phylogeny and species mass in determining factors important for viral spread such as the basic reproductive number, WNV production rate, peak viraemia in blood and competency of a host to infect mosquitoes. Our model is based on a principled analysis and gives a quantitative prediction for key epidemiological determinants and how they vary with species mass and phylogeny. This leads to new hypotheses about the mechanisms that cause certain taxonomic groups to have higher viraemia. For example, our models suggest that higher viral burst sizes cause corvids to have higher levels of viraemia and that the cellular rate of virus production is lower in larger species. We derive a metric of competency of a host to infect disease vectors and thereby sustain the disease between hosts. This suggests that smaller passerine species are highly competent at spreading the disease compared with larger non-passerine species. Our models lend mechanistic insight into why some species (smaller passerine species) are pathogen reservoirs and some (larger non-passerine species) are potentially dead-end hosts for WNV. Our techniques give insights into the role of body mass and host phylogeny in the spread of WNV and potentially other zoonotic diseases. The major contribution of this work is a computational framework for infectious disease modelling at the within-host level that leverages data from multiple species. This is likely to be of interest to modellers of infectious diseases that jump species barriers and infect multiple species. Our method can be used to computationally determine the competency of a host to infect mosquitoes that will sustain WNV and other zoonotic diseases. We find that smaller passerine species are more competent in spreading the disease than larger non-passerine species. This suggests the role of host phylogeny as an important determinant of within-host pathogen replication. Ultimately, we view our work as an important step in linking within-host viral dynamics models to between-host models that determine spread of infectious disease between different hosts.},

abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging pathogen that has decimated bird populations and caused severe outbreaks of viral encephalitis in humans. Currently, little is known about the within-host viral kinetics of WNV during infection. We developed mathematical models to describe viral replication, spread and host immune response in wild-type and immunocompromised mice. Our approach fits a target cell-limited model to viremia data from immunocompromised knockout mice and an adaptive immune response model to data from wild-type mice. Using this approach, we first estimate parameters governing viral production and viral spread in the host using simple models without immune responses. We then use these parameters in a more complex immune response model to characterize the dynamics of the humoral immune response. Despite substantial uncertainty in input parameters, our analysis generates relatively precise estimates of important viral characteristics that are composed of nonlinear combinations of model parameters: we estimate the mean within-host basic reproductive number, R0, to be 2.3 (95{\%} of values in the range 1.7-2.9); the mean infectious virion burst size to be 2.9 plaque-forming units (95{\%} of values in the range 1.7-4.7); and the average number of cells infected per infectious virion to be between 0.3 and 0.99. Our analysis gives mechanistic insights into the dynamics of WNV infection and produces estimates of viral characteristics that are difficult to measure experimentally. These models are a first step towards a quantitative understanding of the timing and effectiveness of the humoral immune response in reducing host viremia and consequently the epidemic spread of WNV.},

abstract = {Rho GTPase-based signaling networks control cellular dynamics by coordinating protrusions and retractions in space and time. Here, we reveal a signaling network that generates pulses and propagating waves of cell contractions. These dynamic patterns emerge via self-organization from an activator-inhibitor network, in which the small GTPase Rho amplifies its activity by recruiting its activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1. Rho also inhibits itself by local recruitment of actomyosin and the associated RhoGAP Myo9b. This network structure enables spontaneous, self-limiting patterns of subcellular contractility that can explore mechanical cues in the extracellular environment. Indeed, actomyosin pulse frequency in cells is altered by matrix elasticity, showing that coupling of contractility pulses to environmental deformations modulates network dynamics. Thus, our study reveals a mechanism that integrates intracellular biochemical and extracellular mechanical signals into subcellular activity patterns to control cellular contractility dynamics.},

abstract = {Microbial community metabolomics, particularly in the human gut, are beginning to provide a new route to identify functions and ecology disrupted in disease. However, these data can be costly and difficult to obtain at scale, while amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing data are readily available for populations of many thousands. Here, we describe a computational approach to predict potentially unobserved metabolites in new microbial communities, given a model trained on paired metabolomes and metagenomes from the environment of interest. Focusing on two independent human gut microbiome datasets, we demonstrate that our framework successfully recovers community metabolic trends for more than 50{\%} of associated metabolites. Similar accuracy is maintained using amplicon profiles of coral-associated, murine gut, and human vaginal microbiomes. We also provide an expected performance score to guide application of the model in new samples. Our results thus demonstrate that this ‘predictive metabolomic' approach can aid in experimental design and provide useful insights into the thousands of community profiles for which only metagenomes are currently available.},

abstract = {Stochasticity and spatial distribution of the pathogen play a critical role in determining the outcome of an infection. 1 in a million immune system cells are specific to a particular pathogen. The serendipitous encounter of such a rare immune system cell with its fated antigen can determine the mortality of the infected animal. Moreover pathogens may remain initially localized in a small volume of tissue. Hence stochastic and spatial aspects play an important role in pathogenesis, especially early on in the infection. Current efforts at investigating the effect of stochasticity and space in modeling of host immune response and pathogens use agent based models (ABMs). However these are computationally expensive. Population level approaches like ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are computationally tractable. However they make simplifying assumptions that are unlikely to be true early on in the infection. We proposed a stage-structured hybrid model that aims to strike a balance between the detail of representation of an ABM and the computational tractability of an ODE model. It uses a spatially explicit ABM in the initial stage of infection, and a coarse-grained but computationally tractable ODE model in the latter stages of infection. Such an approach might hold promise in: 1) modeling of other pathogens where the initial stochasticity of the pathogen dictates the trajectory of pathogenesis, and 2) lead to insights into immune system inspired strategies and architectures for distributed systems of computers.},

abstract = {Dysregulated intestinal immune responses are the cause of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomic approaches we investigate the responses of monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to multiple stimuli and relate those to transcriptional responses in the inflamed intestine. We identify auto- and paracrine sensing of IL-1$\alpha$/$\beta$ and IL-10 regulation as key signals that control the development of inflammatory IL-23-producing monocytes. Uptake of whole bacteria induces IL-10 resistance and favours IL-23 secretion. IL-1$\alpha$/$\beta$+CD14+ monocyte signatures are enriched in patients with ulcerating intestinal inflammation and resistance to anti-TNF therapy. In contrast, IL-23 and tumour necrosis factor expression in the absence of this inflammatory monocyte signature was associated with homeostatic lymphocyte differentiation explaining why IL-23 and TNF expression alone are poor predictors for IBD activity. Gene co-expression analysis assists the identification of IBD patient subgroups that might benefit from IL-23p19 and/or IL-1$\alpha$/IL-1$\beta$-targeting therapies.},

abstract = {The thymus is the primary organ for the generation of naive T cells, a key component of the immune system. Tolerance of T cells to self is achieved primarily in the thymic medulla, where immature T cells (thymocytes) sample self-peptides presented by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). A sufficiently strong interaction activates the thymocytes leading to negative selection. A key question of current interest is whether there is any structure in the manner in which mTECs present peptides: can any mTEC present any peptide at any time, or are there particular patterns of correlated peptide presentation? We investigate this question using a mathematical model of negative selection. We find that correlated patterns of peptide presentation may be advantageous in negatively selecting low-degeneracy thymocytes (that is, those thymocytes which respond to relatively few peptides). We also quantify the probability that an auto-reactive thymocyte exits the thymus before it encounters a cognate antigen. The results suggest that heterogeneity of gene co-expression in mTECs has an effect on the probability of escape of autoreactive thymocytes.},

Our methodology serves as a guideline for practitioners in this field. We also enjoin caution that even in the era of big data more information may not always be better.

abstract = {Crime is ubiquitous and has been around for millennia. Crime is analogous to a pathogenic infection and police response to it is similar to an immune response. The biological immune system is also engaged in an arms race with pathogens. We propose an immune system inspired theory of crime and violence in human societies, especially in large agglomerations like cities. In this work we suggest that an immune system inspired theory of crime can provide a new perspective on the dynamics of violence in societies. The competitive dynamics between police and criminals has similarities to how the immune system is involved in an arms race with invading pathogens. Cities have properties similar to biological organisms and in this theory the police and military forces would be the immune system that protects against detrimental internal and external forces. Our theory has implications for public policy: ranging from how much financial resource to invest in crime fighting, to optimal policing strategies, pre-placement of police, and number of police to be allocated to different cities. Our work can also be applied to other forms of violence in human societies (like terrorism) and violence in other primate societies and eusocial insects. We hope this will be the first step towards a quantitative theory of violence and conflict in human societies. Ultimately we hope that this will help in designing smart and efficient cities that can scale and be sustainable despite population increase.},

We take inspiration from the biological immune system which organizes search for pathogens in a hybrid modular strategy. Our strategy has relevance in search for rare amounts of information in online social networks and could have implications for massively distributed search challenges. Our work also has implications for design of efficient online networks that could have an impact on networks of human collaboration, scientific collaboration and networks used in targeted manhunts. Real world systems, like online social networks, have high associated delays for long-distance links, since they are built on top of physical networks. Such systems have been shown to densify i.e. the average number of neighbours that an individual has increases with time. Hence such networks will have a communication cost due to space and the requirement of building and maintaining and increasing number of connections. We have incorporated such a non-spatial cost to communication in order to introduce the realism of individuals communicating within communities, which we call participation cost. We introduce the notion of a community size that increases with the size of the system, which is shown to reduce the time to search for information in networks. Our final strategy balances search times and participation costs and is shown to decrease time to find information in decentralized search in online social networks. Our strategy also balances strong-ties (within communities) and weak-ties over long distances (between communities that bring in diverse ideas) and may ultimately lead to more productive and innovative networks of human communication and enterprise. We hope that this work will lay the foundation for strategies aimed at producing global scale human interaction networks that are sustainable and lead to a more networked, diverse and prosperous society.},

abstract = {Emerging strains of influenza, such as avian H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1, are more virulent than seasonal H1N1 influenza, yet the underlying mechanisms for these differences are not well understood. Subtle differences in how a given strain interacts with the immune system are likely a key factor in determining virulence. One aspect of the interaction is the ability of T cells to locate the foci of the infection in time to prevent uncontrolled expansion. Here, we develop an agent based spatial model to focus on T cell migration from lymph nodes through the vascular system to sites of infection. We use our model to investigate whether different strains of influenza modulate this process. We calibrate the model using viral and chemokine secretion rates we measure in vitro together with values taken from literature. The spatial nature of the model reveals unique challenges for T cell recruitment that are not apparent in standard differential equation models. In this model comparing three influenza viruses, plaque expansion is governed primarily by the replication rate of the virus strain, and the efficiency of the T cell search-and-kill is limited by the density of infected epithelial cells in each plaque. Thus for each virus there is a different threshold of T cell search time above which recruited T cells are unable to control further expansion. Future models could use this relationship to more accurately predict control of the infection.},

abstract = {Emerging viruses cause a lot of fatalities as they jump to humans from other species. Here we develop a novel technique to computationally estimate an important parameter of within-host viral infection: the lifespan of infected cells. Our approach is general and can be applied to a large class of viruses and leverages experimental data from replicon studies. Current techniques have difficulties reliably estimating infected cell lifetimes due to issues of parameter identifiability and correlation of parameters. The infected cell lifetime is an important parameter that gives an estimate of the how fast virus levels will decline. Our method would also help determine if some infected cells are short-lived or have longer lifespans with the consequence that longer lived cells could be reservoirs of infection. This would give a mechanistic understanding of why particular cell types are reservoirs of infection. We apply our technique to West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging disease of public health relevance related to Zika virus. Our analysis suggests that the most abundant infectible cells are short-lived and could motivate therapy that targets these particular cells. Our approach is very general and can be combined with more traditional methods of using differential equation models to simulate viremia in hosts: the combination of these two techniques will likely yield results that may not be achievable using the models in isolation. This will be of great interest especially in modelling emerging diseases.},

abstract = {Inter-modal terminals (IMT) reduce road congestion and exploit economies of scale by pooling demand from surrounding areas and using rail to transport containers to and from ports. The alternative to using IMTs is using trucks to transport containers directly to and from the port. Trucks increase road congestion but rail requires additional handling of containers (lift on and lift off ). The attractiveness of truck versus rail is dependent on a number of variables such as costs, total travel time, frequency of services, risk, and material resources. To date, the use of open data to analyse and model freight movements has been minimal, primarily because of the shortage of open data focusing on freight movements across cities, regions or countries. In this paper we leverage open government data for the Port Botany rail network and use it to develop exible and dynamic simulation and optimisation tools that enable various stakeholders including IMT operators, port authorities, and government policy makers to make more informed decisions not only about pricing, but also operation scheduling and internal operations.},

Here, we improve a chemo-optogenetic approach and apply it to investigate the signal network that generates these pulses. We use these measurements to derive and parameterize a system of ordinary differential equations describing temporal signal network dynamics. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations predict a strong dependence of oscillatory system dynamics on the concentration of GEF-H1, an Lbc-type RhoGEF, which mediates the positive feedback amplification of Rho activity. This prediction is confirmed experimentally via optogenetic tuning of the effective GEF-H1 concentration in individual living cells. Numerical simulations show that pulse amplitude is most sensitive to external inputs into the myosin component at low GEF-H1 concentrations and that the spatial pulse width is dependent on GEF-H1 diffusion. Our study offers a theoretical framework to explain the emergence of local cell contraction pulses and their modulation by biochemical and mechanical signals.},

@phdthesis{Banerjee2013a,
abstract = {How different is the immune system in a human from that of a mouse? Do pathogens replicate at the same rate in different species? Answers to these questions have impact on human health since multi-host pathogens that jump from animals to humans affect millions worldwide. It is not known how rates of immune response and viral dynamics vary from species to species and how they depend on species body size. Metabolic scaling theory predicts that intracellular processes will be slower in larger animals since cellular metabolic rates are slower. We test how rates of pathogenesis and immune system response rates depend on species body size. We hypothesize that immune response rates are invariant with body size. Our work suggests how the physical architecture of the immune system and chemical signals within it may lead to nearly scale-invariant immune search and response. We fit mathematical models to experimental West Nile Virus (WNV, a multi-host pathogen) infection data and investigate how model parameters characterizing the pathogen and the immune response change with respect to animal mass. Phylogeny also affects pathogenesis and immune response. We use a hierarchical Bayesian model, that incorporates phylogeny, to test hypotheses about the role of mass and phylogeny on pathogen replication and immune response. We observe that: 1. Hierarchical models (informed by phylogeny) make more accurate predictions of experimental data and more realistic estimates of biologically relevant parameters characterizing WNV infection. 2. Rates of WNV production decline with species body mass, modified by a phylogenetic influence. Our work is the first to systematically explore the role of host body mass in pathogenesis using mathematical models and empirical data. We investigate the complex interplay between the physical structure of the immune system and host body mass in determining immune response. The modeling strategies and tools outlined here are likely to be applicable to modeling of other multi-host pathogens. This work could also be extended to understand how drug and vaccine efficacy in humans may systematically differ from that in model organisms like mice, in which most initial experimental studies are conducted.},

On one hand, the original infrastructure plans enhance (or limit) the users' ability to operate efficiently for years to come. As time passes and the payback period approaches, changing operating conditions and unforeseen bottlenecks in the original blueprint can, at best, affect the economic returns and, at worst, defeat the purpose of the whole project (see, for example, Castellon airport in Spain, which was built but is grossly underutilised), producing unanticipated economical, social and political repercussions. On the other hand, managers and operators (that is, those living with the consequences of the strategic planning) have some leeway to compensate for miscalculations by means of their tactical and operational planning. In this chapter, we explore the use of quantitative techniques to, first, amend bottlenecks and uncertain market and operating conditions that affect the performance of infrastructure investments (the tactic and operational levels), and second, validate the effectiveness of the original infrastructure design (the strategic level) under these changing conditions. More specifically, we present a rail scheduling case study where we combine demand forecasting using Machine Learning techniques and formal Operations Research methods to assess and maximise the value of already-existing infrastructure. Rail scheduling is a typical optimisation problem popular in the literature, but its potential value is bounded not only by its technical properties and specifications (how good the algorithm is) but also by the accuracy of data feeding the algorithm. Such data is critical in specifying the demand that a facility will experience in the future, and the costs that will be incurred to operate it. The use of intensive data analytics and appropriate Machine Learning techniques can resolve this and provide a substantial competitive edge for investors and operators of rail inter-modal terminals. We anticipate that Machine Learning algorithms that predict future demand, coupled with optimisation techniques that streamline operations of facilities, can be integrated to create tools that help policy makers and terminal operators maximise the value of their current infrastructure, while meeting ever-changing demand.},

abstract = {Stochasticity and spatial distribution of the pathogen play a critical role in determining the outcome of an infection. 1 in a million immune system cells are specific to a particular pathogen. The serendipitous encounter of such a rare immune system cell with its fated antigen can determine the mortality of the infected animal. Moreover pathogens may remain initially localized in a small volume of tissue. Hence stochastic and spatial aspects play an important role in pathogenesis, especially early on in the infection. Current efforts at investigating the effect of stochasticity and space in modeling of host immune response and pathogens use agent based models (ABMs). However these are computationally expensive. Population level approaches like ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are computationally tractable. However they make simplifying assumptions that are unlikely to be true early on in the infection. We proposed a stage-structured hybrid model that aims to strike a balance between the detail of representation of an ABM and the computational tractability of an ODE model. It uses a spatially explicit ABM in the initial stage of infection, and a coarse-grained but computationally tractable ODE model in the latter stages of infection. Such an approach might hold promise in: 1) modeling of other pathogens where the initial stochasticity of the pathogen dictates the trajectory of pathogenesis, and 2) lead to insights into immune system inspired strategies and architectures for distributed systems of computers.},

abstract = {Crime is ubiquitous and has been around for millennia. Crime is analogous to a pathogenic infection and police response to it is similar to an immune response. The biological immune system is also engaged in an arms race with pathogens. We propose an immune system inspired theory of crime and violence in human societies, especially in large agglomerations like cities. In this work we suggest that an immune system inspired theory of crime can provide a new perspective on the dynamics of violence in societies. The competitive dynamics between police and criminals has similarities to how the immune system is involved in an arms race with invading pathogens. Cities have properties similar to biological organisms and in this theory the police and military forces would be the immune system that protects against detrimental internal and external forces. Our theory has implications for public policy: ranging from how much financial resource to invest in crime fighting, to optimal policing strategies, pre-placement of police, and number of police to be allocated to different cities. Our work can also be applied to other forms of violence in human societies (like terrorism) and violence in other primate societies and eusocial insects. We hope this will be the first step towards a quantitative theory of violence and conflict in human societies. Ultimately we hope that this will help in designing smart and efficient cities that can scale and be sustainable despite population increase.},

abstract = {Emerging strains of influenza, such as avian H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1, are more virulent than seasonal H1N1 influenza, yet the underlying mechanisms for these differences are not well understood. Subtle differences in how a given strain interacts with the immune system are likely a key factor in determining virulence. One aspect of the interaction is the ability of T cells to locate the foci of the infection in time to prevent uncontrolled expansion. Here, we develop an agent based spatial model to focus on T cell migration from lymph nodes through the vascular system to sites of infection. We use our model to investigate whether different strains of influenza modulate this process. We calibrate the model using viral and chemokine secretion rates we measure in vitro together with values taken from literature. The spatial nature of the model reveals unique challenges for T cell recruitment that are not apparent in standard differential equation models. In this model comparing three influenza viruses, plaque expansion is governed primarily by the replication rate of the virus strain, and the efficiency of the T cell search-and-kill is limited by the density of infected epithelial cells in each plaque. Thus for each virus there is a different threshold of T cell search time above which recruited T cells are unable to control further expansion. Future models could use this relationship to more accurately predict control of the infection.},

abstract = {Scientific collaboration networks are an important component of scientific output and contribute significantly to expanding our knowledge and to the economy and gross domestic product of nations. Here we examine a dataset from the Mendeley scientific collaboration network. We analyze this data using a combination of machine learning techniques and dynamical models. We find interesting clusters of countries with different characteristics of collaboration. Some of these clusters are dominated by developed countries that have higher number of self connections compared with connections to other countries. Another cluster is dominated by impoverished nations that have mostly connections and collaborations with other countries but fewer self connections. We also propose a complex systems dynamical model that explains these characteristics. Our model explains how the scientific collaboration networks of impoverished and developing nations change over time. We also find interesting patterns in the behaviour of countries that may reflect past foreign policies and contemporary geopolitics. Our model and analysis gives insights and guidelines into how scientific development of developing countries can be guided. This is intimately related to fostering economic development of impoverished nations and creating a richer and more prosperous society.},

@article{Banerjee2017,
abstract = {Information plays a critical role in complex biological systems. Complex systems like immune systems and ant colonies co-ordinate heterogeneous components in a decentralized fashion. How do these distributed decentralized systems function? One key component is how these complex systems efficiently process information. These complex systems have an architecture for integrating and processing information coming in from various sources and points to the value of information in the functioning of different complex biological systems. This paper is a teaching resource that explains the role of information processing in questions around the origin of life and suggests how computational simulations may yield insights into questions related to the origin of life. A computational model of the origin of life would unify thermodynamics with information processing and we would gain an appreciation of why proteins and nucleotides evolved as the substrate of computation and information processing in living systems that we see on Earth. Answers to questions like these may give us insights into non-carbon based forms of life that we could search for outside Earth.},

abstract = {When stakeholders commit to building infrastructure as part of strategic, long-term planning, the final facilities are not normally amenable to modifica- tion after completion. A consequence of this is that users are forced to operate within the original specifications for, at least, as long as it takes to carry out major refurbishments or retrofitting, and even then, the constraints imposed by the original layout may be inescapable. On one hand, the original infrastructure plans enhance (or limit) the users' ability to operate efficiently for years to come. As time passes and the payback period approaches, changing operating conditions and unforeseen bottlenecks in the original blueprint can, at best, affect the economic returns and, at worst, defeat the purpose of the whole project (see, for example, Castell{\'{o}}n airport in Spain, which was built but is grossly underutilised), producing unanticipated economical, social and political repercussions. On the other hand, managers and operators (that is, those living with the consequences of the strategic planning) have some leeway to compensate for miscalculations by means of their tactical and operational planning. In this chapter, we explore the use of quantitative techniques to, first, amend bottlenecks and uncertain market and operating conditions that affect the per- formance of infrastructure investments (the tactic and operational levels), and second, validate the effectiveness of the original infrastructure design (the strate- gic level) under these changing conditions. More specifically, we present a rail scheduling case study where we combine demand forecasting using Machine Learning techniques and formal Operations Research methods to assess and maximise the value of already-existing infras- tructure. Rail scheduling is a typical optimisation problem popular in the lit- erature, but its potential value is bounded not only by its technical properties and specifications (“how good the algorithm is”) but also by the accuracy of data feeding the algorithm. Such data is critical in specifying the demand that a facility will experience in the future, and the costs that will be incurred to operate it. The use of intensive data analytics and appropriate Machine Learn- ing techniques can resolve this and provide a substantial competitive edge for investors and operators of rail inter-modal terminals. We anticipate that Machine Learning algorithms that predict future de- mand, coupled with optimisation techniques that streamline operations of fa- cilities, can be integrated to create tools that help policy makers and terminal operators maximise the value of their current infrastructure, while meeting ever-changing demand.},
